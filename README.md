TODO Application

## Overview

This TODO application is built using **Expo.dev** and utilizes SQLite for local data storage. The application allows users to organize their tasks efficiently by creating groups or categories, adding tasks within those groups, and managing those tasks through completion, editing, or deletion.

## Features

- **Group Lists**: 
  - Users can create different "groups" or categories to organize their tasks.
  - Each group can be viewed separately, making task management more efficient.

- **Todo Lists**:
  - Users can add multiple tasks within each group.
  - Each task contains a title and description for better clarity and organization.

- **Task Management**:
  - Tasks can be marked as completed or pending.
  - Users can edit task details or delete tasks if they are no longer needed.

- **Data Persistence**:
  - All user data is stored locally using SQLite, ensuring that tasks and groups are saved even when the app is closed.

- **User Interface**:
  - The UI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and modern look inspired by interfaces from Dribbble.

## Screens

1. **Home Screen**:
   - Displays all groups with an option to add new ones.
   
2. **Todo List Screen**:
   - Lists all tasks within a selected group.
   - Provides options to add new tasks or view existing task details.

3. **Task Detail Screen**:
   - Shows detailed information about a selected task.
   - Options to edit or delete the task are available.

4. **Task Creation Screen**:
   - A form for adding a new task or editing an existing one.
   - Fields include task title and description.

## Design Choices

- **React Native & Expo**: 
  - React Native was chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, allowing the app to run on both iOS and Android.
  - Expo simplifies development by providing a set of tools and services that make it easier to build, deploy, and manage the app.

- **SQLite for Data Storage**: 
  - SQLite was selected for its simplicity and ease of integration with React Native. It allows the application to store data locally without requiring a remote database, making it fast and reliable for the app's needs.

- **Navigation**:
  - React Navigation was used to manage screen transitions and navigation between different parts of the application. The stack-based navigation makes it easy to move between screens and manage the backstack.

- **User Interface**:
  - The UI was designed to be clean and minimalistic, focusing on usability. Inspiration was taken from popular design platforms like Dribbble, ensuring the app is visually appealing while remaining functional.

## Challenges Encountered

- **SQLite Integration**:
  - Integrating SQLite with Expo required careful handling of database transactions and queries. Ensuring that the database was correctly initialized and that data was stored and retrieved accurately was a significant challenge.

- **State Management**:
  - Managing the state across different screens, especially when dealing with nested data structures like groups and tasks, required careful planning and execution. Ensuring that the state was updated correctly when tasks were added, edited, or deleted was crucial.

- **Navigation Flow**:
  - Creating a seamless navigation experience between the different screens was challenging. Ensuring that the correct data was passed between screens and that users could navigate back and forth without losing data or context was a key consideration.

- **User Interface Design**:
  - Balancing the app's functionality with a clean and modern UI was challenging. It required multiple iterations to ensure that the app was both visually appealing and easy to use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally using npm:
  
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

### Running the App

- Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code generated by the Expo development server.
- Alternatively, you can run the app on an Android or iOS simulator.

## Future Improvements

- **Cloud Syncing**: Integrate cloud storage options like Firebase to allow users to sync their tasks across multiple devices.
- **Notifications**: Add push notifications to remind users about pending tasks or deadlines.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implement advanced filtering and sorting options for tasks, allowing users to manage their workload more efficiently.
